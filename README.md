# ðŸŽ“ Education Platform API

A comprehensive education platform backend built with Laravel, providing authentication, course management, content delivery, and student enrollment functionality through RESTful API endpoints.

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack

- **Backend Framework**: Laravel 10+
- **Authentication**: Laravel Sanctum
- **Database**: MySQL / SQLite (configurable via `.env`)
- **API Testing**: Postman / Thunder Client recommended

## ðŸ‘¥ User Roles

The platform supports three user roles, each with different permissions:

1. **Student**
   - Can enroll in courses
   - Can view course content (lectures, assignments, quizzes, labs)
   - Can view their enrolled courses

2. **Instructor**
   - Can create and manage their own courses
   - Can add/edit/delete course content
   - Can view students enrolled in their courses
   - Can update student enrollment status

3. **Manager**
   - Has all instructor permissions
   - Can manage all courses, including those created by other instructors
   - Can manage all users
