## 🚀 How to Test the Student Dashboard

### Step 1: Start the Application
```bash
php artisan serve
```
The application will be available at: `http://127.0.0.1:8001`

### Step 2: Login as Student
1. Navigate to: `http://127.0.0.1:8001/login`
2. Enter credentials:
   - Email: `student@test.com`
   - Password: `password123`
3. Click "Login"
4. You should be redirected to: `http://127.0.0.1:8001/dashboard`

### Step 3: Test Dashboard Features
1. **Enrolled Courses Section**
   - Should display 3 enrolled courses
   - Each course shows title, code, and progress

2. **Upcoming Assignments Section**
   - Should display 5 upcoming assignments
   - Shows assignment titles and due dates

3. **Upcoming Quizzes Section**
   - Should display 5 upcoming quizzes
   - Shows quiz titles and start times

4. **Recent Activity Section**

   - Shows enrollment, assignment, and quiz activities

### Step 4: Test API Endpoints Directly
Use the provided test tools:
- Open `test_student_functionality.html` in a browser
- Run `test_student_apis.ps1` in PowerShell
- Use the generated token for manual API testing

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Authentication Flow
1. User submits login credentials
2. Server validates credentials against database
3. JWT token generated using Laravel Sanctum
4. Token returned to client with user data and redirect URL
5. Client stores token and redirects based on user role

### API Security
- All student dashboard APIs require authentication
- JWT tokens validated on each request
- Role-based access control implemented
- CORS properly configured for cross-origin requests

### Data Relationships
- Students enrolled in courses via `course_user` pivot table
- Assignments, quizzes, and labs linked to courses
- Progress tracking ready for implementation
- GPA calculation method implemented in User model

## 🎯 Next Steps for Enhancement

   - Implement actual activity logging
   - Replace placeholder data with real activities

2. **Progress Tracking**
   - Add completion tracking for lectures
   - Implement assignment submission tracking
   - Add quiz attempt tracking

3. **Interactive Features**
