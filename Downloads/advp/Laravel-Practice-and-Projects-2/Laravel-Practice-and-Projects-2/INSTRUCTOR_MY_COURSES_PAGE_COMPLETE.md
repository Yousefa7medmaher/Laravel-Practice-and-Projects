# 📚 **INSTRUCTOR "MY COURSES" PAGE - COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION**

## 🎯 **Mission Accomplished: Restricted Course Access Page**

The instructor "My Courses" page has been completely rebuilt to enforce strict access control, showing only courses assigned by managers through the CourseAssignment system.

### ✅ **Multi-Layer Security:**
1. **Middleware Protection:** `InstructorCourseAccess` middleware on all routes
2. **API Restrictions:** Backend enforces assignment verification
3. **Frontend Filtering:** UI only displays assigned courses
4. **Database Constraints:** Active assignment requirement
