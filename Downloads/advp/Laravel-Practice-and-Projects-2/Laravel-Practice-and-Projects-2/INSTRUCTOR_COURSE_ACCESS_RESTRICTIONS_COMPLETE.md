# 🔒 **INSTRUCTOR COURSE ACCESS RESTRICTIONS - COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION**

## 🎯 **Mission Accomplished: Complete Course Access Control**

Instructors can now **ONLY** access courses that have been specifically assigned to them by managers. All course-related functionality is restricted to assigned courses only.

---

## 🛡️ **Security Implementation**

### ✅ **1. Middleware Protection: `InstructorCourseAccess`**

**Location:** `app/Http/Middleware/InstructorCourseAccess.php`

**Functionality:**
- Automatically checks if instructors are accessing only their assigned courses
- Validates course ownership for all content (lectures, assignments, quizzes, labs, materials)
- Returns 403 Forbidden for unauthorized access attempts
- Only applies to instructors (managers bypass this restriction)

**Route Parameters Checked:**
- `courseId` - Direct course access
- `lectureId` - Lecture content access
- `assignmentId` - Assignment content access  
- `quizId` - Quiz content access
- `labId` - Lab content access
- `materialId` - Material content access

### ✅ **2. Route Protection Applied**

**Protected Route Groups:**
```php
// All instructor content management routes
Route::prefix('instructor')->middleware(['auth:sanctum', 'instructor.course.access'])

// All instructor data API routes  
Route::prefix('instructor-data')->middleware(['auth:sanctum', 'instructor.course.access'])
```

**Protected Endpoints:**
- `/api/instructor/courses/{courseId}/*` - All course-specific operations
- `/api/instructor/lectures/{lectureId}` - Lecture management
- `/api/instructor/assignments/{assignmentId}` - Assignment management
- `/api/instructor/quizzes/{quizId}` - Quiz management
- `/api/instructor/labs/{labId}` - Lab management
- `/api/instructor/materials/{materialId}` - Material management

---

## 🔗 **Data Service Restrictions**

### ✅ **Enhanced InstructorDataService**

**Key Changes:**
1. **`getInstructorCourses()`** - Only returns actively assigned courses
2. **`getInstructorContent()`** - Only returns content from assigned courses
3. **`getInstructorStudents()`** - Only returns students from assigned courses

**Active Assignment Verification:**
```php
->whereHas('courseAssignments', function ($query) use ($instructorId) {
    $query->where('instructor_id', $instructorId)
          ->where('is_active', true);
})
```

**Benefits:**
- Automatic filtering at the data layer
- No orphaned data access
- Real-time assignment status checking
- Complete audit trail maintenance

## 🎮 **New Instructor Course Controller**

### ✅ **`InstructorCourseController` - Restricted Access Only**

**Location:** `app/Http/Controllers/InstructorCourseController.php`

**New Endpoints:**
```
GET /api/instructor/assigned-courses           # Only assigned courses
GET /api/instructor/courses/{courseId}/details # Detailed course info (if assigned)
GET /api/instructor/assignment-history         # Course assignment history
GET /api/instructor/dashboard-summary          # Restricted dashboard data
```

**Security Features:**
- Double verification: middleware + controller-level checks
- Detailed course information only for assigned courses
- Assignment history tracking
- Comprehensive error handling

---

## 🖥️ **Frontend Integration**

### ✅ **Updated Instructor Dashboard**

**Key Changes:**
- **Course Loading:** Now uses `/api/instructor/assigned-courses`
- **Content Creation:** Only shows assigned courses in dropdowns
- **Navigation:** Links only work for assigned courses
- **Statistics:** Only calculated from assigned courses

**User Experience:**
- Clear messaging when no courses are assigned
- Automatic course filtering in all interfaces
- Consistent access control across all features

---

## 🔄 **Assignment Workflow Integration**

### ✅ **Manager Course Assignment Process**

**When Manager Assigns Courses:**
1. **Database Updates:**
   - `courses.instructor_id` updated
   - `CourseAssignment` record created with `is_active = true`
   - All existing content gets `instructor_id` updated

2. **Automatic Content Linking:**
   - `InstructorDataService::updateContentInstructorIds()`
   - Links all lectures, assignments, quizzes, labs, materials
   - Maintains data integrity

3. **Notification System:**
   - Instructor receives assignment notification
   - Other managers receive update notification
   - Real-time access granted

**When Manager Unassigns Courses:**
1. **Database Updates:**
   - `courses.instructor_id` set to null
   - `CourseAssignment` record marked `is_active = false`
   - Content `instructor_id` removed

2. **Automatic Access Revocation:**
   - `InstructorDataService::removeContentInstructorIds()`
   - Immediate access restriction
   - Clean data separation

3. **Notification System:**
   - Instructor receives unassignment notification
   - Managers receive update notification
   - Real-time access revoked

## 🛡️ **Security Layers**

### **Layer 1: Route Middleware**
- `InstructorCourseAccess` middleware on all instructor routes
- Automatic parameter validation
- 403 Forbidden for unauthorized access

### **Layer 2: Controller Verification**
- Double-check in controller methods
- Active assignment verification
- Detailed error messages

### **Layer 3: Data Service Filtering**
- Database-level filtering
- Only active assignments returned
- Automatic content restriction

### **Layer 4: Frontend Restrictions**
- API endpoint changes
- UI element filtering
- Consistent user experience

## 📊 **Access Control Matrix**

| User Role | Course Access | Content Access | Student Access | Grading Access |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Instructor** | ✅ Assigned Only | ✅ Assigned Only | ✅ Assigned Only | ✅ Assigned Only |
| **Manager** | ✅ All Courses | ✅ All Content | ✅ All Students | ✅ All Grading |
| **Student** | ✅ Enrolled Only | ✅ Enrolled Only | ❌ No Access | ❌ No Access |
