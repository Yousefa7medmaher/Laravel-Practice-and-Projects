## 🔧 **Bug Fixes & Enhancements**

### **User Model Enhancements:**
Added missing methods to the User model:
- `getCurrentCreditHours()` - Calculate current enrolled credit hours
- `getMaxCreditHours()` - Determine max credits based on GPA
- `canEnrollInCourse($courseId)` - Check enrollment eligibility
- `getEnrollmentStats()` - Get comprehensive enrollment statistics

### **Credit Hour Validation System:**
- **GPA-based Limits**: New students (15), GPA >2.0 (18), GPA >3.0 (21)
- **Real-time Validation**: Prevents enrollment if credit limit would be exceeded
- **User-friendly Messages**: Clear error messages explaining credit limits

### **Enhanced Filtering:**
- **Department Filters**: Computer Science (CS) and Mathematics (MATH/MAT)
- **Credit Hour Filters**: 3-credit and 4-credit course filtering
- **Enrollment Status**: Available, Enrolled, All courses filtering

## 🎨 **Design System Consistency**

### **Visual Elements:**
- **Consistent Color Scheme**: Indigo/purple gradients matching dashboard
- **Typography**: Same font hierarchy and sizing throughout
- **Spacing**: Identical grid system and component spacing
- **Animations**: Matching hover effects, transitions, and loading states

### **Component Patterns:**
- **Navigation Header**: Identical across all pages with active state indicators
- **Card Layouts**: Consistent shadow, border radius, and hover effects
- **Button Styles**: Uniform styling for primary, secondary, and disabled states
- **Form Elements**: Matching input fields, search bars, and filter buttons

## 🔌 **API Integration Architecture**

### **Endpoints Used:**
- `GET /api/profile` - User profile information
- `GET /api/public/courses` - All available courses for enrollment
- `GET /api/student/enrolled-courses` - Student's enrolled courses
- `GET /api/student/upcoming-assignments` - Upcoming assignment deadlines
- `POST /api/courses/{id}/enroll` - Course enrollment functionality
- `POST /api/logout` - Secure logout

### **Authentication Flow:**
1. JWT token validation on page load
2. Automatic redirect to login if unauthorized
3. Token storage in localStorage for persistence
4. Secure API calls with proper headers
